Project Brief: Ultimate Frisbee Coaching and Training App

Project Name:
Spartans

Purpose:
To develop a unified mobile/web application that serves as the central hub for managing and tracking training activities, progress, and competitions for an Ultimate Frisbee club. This app will replace the current Google Sheets-based system and reflect the club’s philosophy of self-improvement and transparency.

The app will emphasize shared accountability and progress, providing the same user experience for all stakeholders, including coaches and players. It will streamline data management, improve accessibility, and foster a culture of personal growth and collaboration.

Philosophy and Context
The club’s mission centers around self-improvement and transparency. By creating a platform where everyone—coaches and players—has equal access to progress tracking and training data, the app will reflect these values.

The app will empower users to:

Understand their personal growth and development.
Track their contributions and participation in the club.
Stay informed about collective goals like tournaments and milestones.
Foster an environment of mutual accountability.
This project transitions the club from a manual, spreadsheet-driven system to a purpose-built app that enables better organization and enhances the user experience.
