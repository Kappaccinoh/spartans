Project Brief for Frontend Engineer and Designer
Project Name: Spartans
Objective for Frontend Engineer and Designer
To design and implement a user-friendly, unified interface that reflects the club’s philosophy of self-improvement and transparency. The focus is on creating a seamless user experience where players and coaches interact with the same UI to track progress, log actions, and view milestones.

Design and Development Philosophy
Transparency: The UI must present information in a clear, accessible way for both players and coaches, with equal access to all features.
User Motivation: The design should inspire users by showcasing personal and team progress visually.

Frontend Implementation: Functional pages that align with the designs, integrating with the backend for real-time data updates.
Timeline
Design Phase:

Wireframes: 1–2 weeks.
High-fidelity designs and prototypes: 2–3 weeks.
Frontend Development:

Component implementation: 2–3 weeks.

Frontend Component Directory Structure
Here’s an example of how your components/ directory might be structured for reusability:

bash
Copy
Edit
components/
│
├── Profile/
│   ├── ProfileCard.js         # Displays user profile details.
│   ├── FeedbackList.js        # List of feedback items.
│   └── Leaderboard.js         # Displays leaderboard ranking and points.
│
├── Comments/
│   ├── CommentCard.js         # Individual feedback card.
│   ├── PlayerSearch.js        # Search and filter bar for players.
│   └── FeedbackForm.js        # Form to add/edit feedback.
│
├── ActionsLog/
│   ├── Timeline.js            # Timeline of player actions.
│   └── LogActionForm.js       # Form to add a new action.
│
├── Tournaments/
│   ├── TournamentCard.js      # Displays tournament details and eligibility.
│   └── ProgressBar.js         # Progress bar for eligibility.
│
├── Milestones/
│   ├── MilestoneCard.js       # Displays a milestone and its progress.
│   └── AddMilestoneForm.js    # Form to add new milestones.
│
└── Shared/
    ├── Navbar.js              # Navbar component.
    ├── Footer.js              # Footer component.
    └── Button.js              # Reusable button component.
API Integration Example
Fetching User Data for Profile Page:
javascript
Copy
Edit
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { userId } = context.params;
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.spartansclub.com/user/${userId}`);
  const user = await res.json();
  return {
    props: { user }, // Pass data to the page as props
  };
}
By following this routing structure, the app will have a logical and modular architecture that is easy to scale and maintain.
